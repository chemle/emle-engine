An engine for electrostatic embedding of machine learning potentials.
Based on `code <https://github.com/emedio/embedding>`__ by Kirill Zinovjev.
Technical details can be found in our paper, available `here <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00248>`__.
Please cite this work if you use ``emle-engine`` in your research. Supplementary
information and data can be found `here <https://github.com/chemle/emle-engine-paper>`__.
For the original theory behind ``EMLE``, please refer to `this <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00914>`__
publication.

The general purpose embedding model currently supports HCNOS elements. We plan
to add support for further elements in the near future.

We thank EPSRC for funding (grant code EP/V011421/1).
